# Bernoulli Distribution Presentation

This repository contains the materials for the **Bernoulli Distribution** presentation, as part of Group 9's assignment.

## Project Overview
The Bernoulli distribution models a single binary trial with two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0). It is a fundamental distribution in probability theory and statistics, often used to model scenarios where there is a single event with two possible outcomes.

### Key Features:
- Explanation of the Bernoulli distribution
- Relevant mathematical formula and a practical example
- Python code implemented with `numpy` for simulating a Bernoulli trial
- Visual representation of the probability mass function (PMF)
- A video presentation of the project
